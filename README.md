## How to Play:

1. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or WASD keys (W for up, A for left, S for down, D for right) to control your snake's direction.
2. Consume the food that appears on the screen to grow longer.
3. Avoid running into the walls or colliding with your own tail â€“ those are game over!
